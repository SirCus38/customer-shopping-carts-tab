# Customer Shopping Carts Tab - Magento 2 Extension 
It will enable shopping carts tab at customer edit interface in admin. Which means, it will fix issue https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6287 mentioned in Magento 2 GitHub repository

There is already a pull request https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/20918 going on from us regarding fix of this problem in Magento 2 core. But unfortunately Magento 2 guys are little slow to process the pull request so not sure in which Magento 2 version the change will be included.

Hence, we have extracted changes from our pull request and packaged them in this extension. Please feel free to use it till the time this change will be part of Magento 2 core.
